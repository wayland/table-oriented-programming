<ul>
  <li>A <code>Lot</code> allows Fields to be grouped together in an ordered 
    Lot; basically an ordered array of fields</li>
  <li>These Lots should be usable by things like select, unique, and the like.  
    When creating a relation, it's possible to include a Lot, which includes 
    its alloted fields.  </li>
  <li>While PostgreSQL's composite types (cf. 
    <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtype.html">CREATE
    TYPE</a>) are intended for creating data types, the Lots here are 
    probably less specific, and can have a broader range of uses.  </li>
  <li>A <code>Lot</code> is not restricted to including Fields; it can include
    other <code>Lot</code>s.  When a <code>Lot</code> is used, these are 
    expanded out to represent the actual fields.  </li>
  <li>There should be some predefined Lots (built in by default) that make it 
    easy to construct a data dictionary like the example one on the 
    <code><a href="TOP/Raku/DataDictionary.xml">DataDictionary</a></code>
    page.</li>
  <li>It'd be nice to know how we're going to handle multi-lingual interfaces</li>
</ul>

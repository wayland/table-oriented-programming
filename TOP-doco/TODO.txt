TODO

Content
-------

Under Stylistic Features, add a section/page called "Multi-Aspect Taxonomies":
-	Pull in some of the material from the Tree criticism page, especially the quote at the top
-	Talk about how taxonomies need to be multi-aspect (did I write anything on the Trees page about this?)
-	Rework the Trees page, if any of it is still useful


-	Make TOP/Comparisons/Raku-and-xHarbour.xml .  Make it quite clear which parts of Raku TOP are not implemented yet








-	Make the Language Analogy a separate page; pull in the noun-verb priority stuff
-	Pull in material from https://web.archive.org/web/20121102222751/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/oopbad.htm#isa

#TODO Maybe write an article about why Raku is the perfect programming language for research, because:
#-       Flexible grammar, slangs
#-       Already has many paradigms -- no need to reinvent the wheel



Interface
---------

-	After the above, see if I can get it working with Chromium

-	Then try to make the menus work on mobile -- there might be some ideas at https://freefrontend.com/css-mobile-menus/
	-	Maybe put the previous/next navigation at the top, and the menu icon in the centre

-	Make the Language Analogy a separate page; pull in the noun-verb priority stuff
-	Pull in material from https://web.archive.org/web/20121102222751/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/oopbad.htm#isa



-	Maybe make another page (based on the TOPMind stuff) that talks about how categorisation systems have to be fit-for-purpose
-	Pull in material from https://web.archive.org/web/20121102222751/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/oopbad.htm#isa
-	Make the multiple categorisations point



-	Redo the site in xsl.  What we need is:
	-	One xml schema for the UI
	-	One XML schema for the site map (to generate the menu)
	-	One XML schema for the content (mostly just HTML -- or can we just use HTML in an iframe?)

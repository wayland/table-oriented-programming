Content
-------

-	Document Raku classes
	-	Raku TOP Comparison page
		-	Make the "Other Function Groups" section at the top of the page into an All Function Groups
			thing, with links either to the sections below or to external pages
	-	Raku RAD Comparison page -- make another page that does RAD comparison
		-	Specifically, pull the User Interface and Terminal sections from
			https://harbour.github.io/doc/index.html .  Note that there are multiples of each section
			on that page (under API, commands, etc)
			-	Also need to pull in audio stuff; I think there are audio programming languages
				xHarbour: Environment: Tone
			-	Events: the keyboard stuff
	-	Design Raku RAD/Raku Code Office (at least a UI API, anyway)
	-	Start work
		-	For each class, write a guide for people doing backend classes, telling them not to read the whole thing 
			into memory, because we want to be able to work with really large data

-	Make the Language Analogy a separate page; pull in the noun-verb priority stuff
-	Pull in material from https://web.archive.org/web/20121102222751/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/oopbad.htm#isa

#TODO Maybe write an article about why Raku is the perfect programming language for research, because:
#-       Flexible grammar, slangs
#-       Already has many paradigms -- no need to reinvent the wheel



Interface
---------

-	After the above, see if I can get it working with Chromium
-	Make table-of-contents work in XSL

-	Then try to make the menus work on mobile -- there might be some ideas at https://freefrontend.com/css-mobile-menus/
	-	Maybe put the previous/next navigation at the top, and the menu icon in the centre


Repo
----

Remove the entire generated/ section, and maybe move the doco into the root of the tree


Questions for the Raku people
-----------------------------


Question 1
----------
I'm trying to create a Table class which can be passed a record with values of particular types.  

Is it possible to:
-	Pass a signature to an object on creation
-	Later use that signature to constrain a set of values passed in




Two-dimensional Programming
---------------------------
-	Table-Oriented Programming
-	Dataflow Programming
-	?UI drawing
-	Office Programming
	-	Spreadsheet = TOP
	-	Writer = Reports, but also coding; we can have styles with meaning




Rococo
------
Raku

Code
Office

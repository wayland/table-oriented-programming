<div class="title">Multi-paradigm Programming</div>

<p>Each programming paradigm is a tool in your toolbox.  The more paradigms a 
programming language allows for, the more tools you have in your toolbox.  
Each paradigm not available is one less tool in your toolbox.  </p>

<p>With this in mind, the best way to get the benefits of table-oriented 
programming (TOP) is not to use a TOP programming language, but to integrate TOP 
into a language which is already multi-paradigm.  My personal preference is 
Raku; see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_multi-paradigm_programming_languages">
Wikipedia: Comparison of multi-paradigm programming languages</a> for other good 
options; the top contenders are C++ (with libraries), Common Lisp (with 
libraries), Haskell (with libraries), Julia (with libraries), Oz, and "Wolfram 
Language & Mathematica".</p>

<h2>Merging TOP and OOP?</h2>

<p>The originators of Table-Oriented Programming, Findy Services and B. Jacobs, 
were interested in the possibility of merging TOP and OOP.  Their thought that 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121111044000/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/merge.htm">
objects be stored in a relational format</a> have been borne out by many of the 
current uses that relational databases are put to, especially via ORMs.  </p>

<div class="blockquote">
Perhaps the best of TOP and OOP can be combined into a
very useful programming language. There are enough
similarities between the two to spark new thinking.
It is our opinion that OOP designers have been too
caught up in building structures in memory that they
neglected flexible persistent storage techniques,
among others.

<div class="reference">
        <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/top.htm">Table-Oriented Programming</a></i>, Findy Services and B. Jacobs, 1998-2002
</div>
</div>

<p>Their desire, however, was that there be an automatic mapping between objects 
and table (or view) rows.  This level of integration is, while useful at times, 
often closer than desirable.  </p>

<p>They also believed that the following differences 
prevented this from happening, and were "probably irreconcilable":</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<ol>
<li> Algorithms (methods) and Data are <b>not</b> tightly
     integrated in TOP. This tends to offer less
     method-to-data mapping "protection" than OOP, but results
     in less preprocessing and mapping of the data to be used
     within TOP.

<p>
<li> TOP uses sets and relations in place of
     class hierarchies. It is thus a different
     form of inheritance. (TOP does not value
     hierarchies as highly as OOP because they
     are seen as too inflexible to change. Changes
     often do not occur in a hierarchical way).

<p>
<li> TOP attempts to have a built-in relationship
     with relational systems to reduce or minimize
     data mapping.
</ol>

<div class="reference">
        <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/top.htm">Table-Oriented Programming</a></i>, Findy Services and B. Jacobs, 1998-2002
</div>
</div>

<p>In the more decoupled model used in multi-paradigm programming, these are by 
no means insurmountable.  

<p>The third item is certainly reconcilable -- just make the relationship 
between the table and the relational system optional; if you want the automatic 
data mapping, then set a setting, and it will happen.  If not, then don't.  </p>

<p>The above will likely mean that certain styles of TOP are not possible in a 
TOP+OOP language, but this doesn't invalidate all the other benefits that TOP 
can bring to a language.  It just means that Findy Services and B. Jacobs 

won't be able to use some of their favourit
 TOP idioms.  </p>

<h1>Raku's Strengths</h1>

<p>Findy Services and B. Jacobs also highlighted the weaknesses of C++ and Java 
(the primary OOP languages of his time) that prevent them from properly 
supporting TOP.  These missing features were:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<b>Ability to evaluate strings with internal functions.</b>
  This ability is crucial to
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121111044032/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/cntrl1.htm">
Control Tables</a> and useful for
  many other purposes. Although a "side language" can be added
  to Java and C++, this approach has many limitations. For one, it
  splits your code between the regular language and the side
  language where each language has a tough time communicating
  with the other.

<div class="reference">
        <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121111044032/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/funcs.htm">Notes on Syntax</a></i>, Findy Services and B. Jacobs, 1998-2002
</div>
</div>

<p>Raku's quoting constructs include double-quoted strings which have the 
<a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/quoting#Quoting_constructs">Ability to 
evaluate strings with internal functions</a>.  It may be necessary to 
combine this with Raku's anonymous functions, found in the Blocks and Lambdas 
section of <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/functions">Functions</a>, to 
experience the full power of Raku here.  </li>

<div class="blockquote">

<b>Adequate Context Reduction.</b> This is the ability
  to avoid redundancy in syntax that repeats itself over large
  stretches of code. Reducing this repetition not only reduces
  typing, but also makes the relevant information more visible
  to the reader, reducing reading errors.
  The "with table" example above shows an example
  of Context Reduction. You can also read about variations
  in our
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121111044032/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/newlang.htm#context">
proposed TOP language</a>
  discussion. Note that avoiding quotes for field names is also a
  form of context reduction.

<div class="reference">
	<i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121111044032/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/funcs.htm">Notes on Syntax</a></i>, Findy Services and B. Jacobs, 1998-2002
</div>
</div>

<p>One of Raku's inheritances from Perl is a great awareness of context.  The 
cited <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121111044032/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/funcs.htm">
"with table" example</a> can be easily done in Raku using a 
<a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/control#given">"given" block</a> which 
basically performs the same function.</p>

<p>Having said that, one of the down sides of a multi-paradigm language is 
balancing the needs of all the paradigms; we can't quite reduce context to the 
level of avoiding quotes on field names, but we might be able get away with 
using angle-quotes as both the associative array indicator and the quotation 
marks, as per <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/subscripts#Subscripts">
Associative Subscripting</a>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<b>Clause-based syntax</b>.
  Clause-based syntax is a kind of compromise between
  position-based parameters and named parameters.
  The "copy from" example above shows an example of
  clause-based syntax and discusses some of it's
  advantages. Some implementation suggestions can
  be found in our
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121111044032/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/newlang.htm#clause">
proposed TOP language</a>
  discussion.

<div class="reference">
        <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121111044032/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/funcs.htm">Notes on Syntax</a></i>, Findy Services and B. Jacobs, 1998-2002
</div>
</div>

<p>Raku, rather than compromising between positional and named parameters, 
allows both.  If someone were really desperate to have clause-based parameters, 
it would be achievable via a Slang.  An example would be 
<a href="https://raku.land/zef:tony-o/Slang::SQL">Slang::SQL</a>, which allows 
SQL code to be embedded directly in Raku.</p>




-	B Jacobs wants to make almost everything a table -- this, like the 
	"everything is *only* an object" people, is going too far.  
-	In his unification of Tables and Objects, he wants to automatically map from 
	objects to table rows and back again.

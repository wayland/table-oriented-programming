It seems that paradigms are like colors, cars,
and clothes--everybody has their favorite.
What works for one person, culture, or application 
may not work well for another.
To say that object paradigms are the best organization
tool in a general sense strikes us as arrogant.
It is like saying, "Yellow is the best color for everybody."
<p>
<!-- [example suppressed for now]
Think about school. Some learned more at lectures, some learned
more by reading the textbook, others liked note-cards. Some
related to diagrams, others related to analogies better, etc.
We each have different ways of organizing information in
our minds. It is a [b]mistake[/b] to assume that others
will think and work best if they try to organize information like you.
(Some crossover may happen given enough exposure, but this
is not proof that it is best for most.)

What if somebody walked
up to your desk and started telling
you <b>how</b> to organize your desk's contents?
Most would say that this is
silly. However, this is almost exactly what is being done with
OOP. Paradigms are about organizing software information to make
it easier for <b>developers</b> to work with it. It has nothing
to do with users nor the <a href="#model">outside world</a>
(as long as specifications
and good UI design principles are followed). It is all about
modeling the developer's mind, and no OO proponent knows my
mind better than me.
<p>
You can tell a wood craftsman how you
want the <b>end result</b>, but you are foolish to tell him how
to construct it.
If you are also a wood crafter, then you can
offer tips, but only each individual knows what works best
for themself in the end. (There are issues of maintenance teams,
but this is too involved to discuss here.)
<p>
There are 
<a href="paradgms.htm">other paradigms</a>
 that are not heard about in the press
and brochures, or perhaps not yet fully explored, that could be
an equal or better approach for an entity 
(person, culture, or application) than
object paradigms. Even procedural programming is under-explored
in some cases. Also, many programmers mistakenly use C as
representative of procedural languages and are glad to
move on to C++, which does offer more power simply because
it has more features and vendor tools for it.
<p>
The OOP prophets out there promoting OO may
indeed find objects better for <b>themselves</b> or their teams.
However, they should not extrapolate this to everyone.
Just because they think in terms of OOP objects does not mean
everyone else does. I find that software designers and builders
think very differently from each other. <b>The human mind
and business cultures come in many flavors, so perhaps
our paradigms should do the same.</b>
(This makes for an interesting debate topic:
should one change the paradigm to fit one's mind or change
one's mind to fit the paradigm?)

<p>
I often hear OO proponents say something along the
lines of, "I always built my software in an OO-ish way, I
just did not have a name for it. Then OOP formally came along
and I was happy to see it built into the language."
<p>
I, on the other hand, think best in terms of
<a href="top.htm">tables</a> and like to organize software projects using 
<a href="cntrl1.htm">control tables</a>. I have seen others do the same without ever
knowing that they were using a "table paradigm." 
While OOP attempts to keep you on course by putting up edge 
barriers, control tables keep you on course by giving you a better view of the course.
They both have similar goals, but use very different approaches to achieve these 
goals. If Table Oriented Programming were simply given a 
 recognized identity, other tablers might also come
forward. Another table fan had this to say:

<blockquote><i>
...I was always told that OO was an
intuitive way of thinking. Although I develop daily in OO languages,
I do find OO rather unintuitive (although I manage). ...
If I analyze a problem, I draw tables not objects and classes, I think in
tables, those are much more intuitive to me. Even when I program in OOP,
I rely as much as possible on tables. ...it's nice to see that I'm not
the only one who 'thinks' in tables. ...
</i></blockquote>

<h2> Cult Oriented Programming May Just Work </h2>
</font>

In chapter 3 of
<i>The Rise &amp; Resurrection of the American Programmer</i>, page 63,
Edward Yourdon gives some statistics from studies
about OOP projects.
It seems that early Smalltalk projects, for example, were quite successful,
but later ones did not score higher than the average language
score. Yourdon's speculation for this change is that early
projects had more Smalltalk (language-specific)
"fanatics" on them, but later
ones had a more mixed crowd. Smalltalk became the "in" language
for a while and people rushed into it because that is where
the money was. The earlier Smalltalkers chose Smalltalk
mostly because they liked it.
<p>
This implies that a programmer's personal preference
is more important to getting results than the
language or paradigm itself. In other-words, if a
programmer can work with the tools and languages
that he or she most prefers, then <b>productivity
and quality may be much higher</b> than from passing down
edicts based on a blanket choice of tool, language,
or paradigm.
<p>
My personal experience tends to confirm this. When
given tools that allow me to maximize
my use of 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121102222751/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/top.htm">
Table Oriented Programming</a>, for example,
I seem to get things done much faster and am more
satisfied with the results. I have heard fans of
other languages and techniques say similar things.
<p>
Thus, if you really want to get things done,
hire a zealot or a team of like-minded zealots.
"The best tool for the mind" might be just as important
as "best tool for the job".
Regardless, Zealot Oriented Programming is
an area ripe for more research.


<blockquote><small> One caveat is the some zealots
focus too much on following a certain methodology rather
than getting something done. Thus, you have to be
careful about distinguishing ideological zealots
from practical zealots. It just may be that
different forms of zealotry are needed for different
situations. For example, the Eiffel language and philosophy
involve building many "safety-checks" into the software
to assure compliance with specifications. This philosophy
and it's corresponding followers may not do well
if fast turnaround time is required, but may be ideal
for life-support hospital applications or missile
applications, where mistakes can be deadly.

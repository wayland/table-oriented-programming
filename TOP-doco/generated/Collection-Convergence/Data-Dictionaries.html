<div class="title">Data Dictionaries</div>

<div class="tagline">Tim Nelson, 2024</div>

<div id="table-of-contents"></div>

<div class="blockquote">

Data dictionaries (DD's) are sort of a <b>table describing a table(s).</b> A DD 
differs from a common table structure list in that it may apply to more than one 
table, and it can also assign functions or behavior to handle common or related 
operations. DD's are often described as only a documentation tool in some 
literature; however, we are extending or allowing them to also be used for the 
centralized storage of field-related properties and/or operations actually used 
in software.

<p>Under ideal conditions, the DD provides enough information to generate input 
screens, multi-row grids, and reports without programming these from scratch. It 
keeps all logic related to a field or column in <b>one central place</b>, 
similar to the goal of an OOP class or subclass. It is much easier to find and 
change information in DD tables than hunting through separate modules or 
subclasses in program code. DD's are not intended to replace all program code, 
just reduce the need for it except down at the true customization level where it 
belongs.</p>

...

<h3>Standard Collection Operations</h3>

<p>A good table-oriented system gives every collection (such as tables) a 
standard set of operations that can be used on <b>all</b> tables. 

<div class="reference">
	<i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/top.htm">Table-Oriented Programming</a></i>, Tablizer/TOPMind, 1998-2002
</div>
</div>

<p>The implication is that the collection operations above can also be applied 
to Data Dictionaries.  </p>

<p>The sections in yellow are an edited quote from Tablizer/TOPMind.  
The 
primary changes are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>While the authors have done a good job of using terminology their 
		readers would be familiar with, there are some places where it's 
		useful to update the terminology </li>
	<li>Obvious mistakes corrected</li>
</ul>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>First, we will present an example data dictionary portion. ... We will refer to parts of it below to explain 
certain concepts. </p>

<p>Note that a Data Dictionary can have many more columns than shown and can be 
organized in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/ddsamp.htm">different ways</a>.
</p>

...

<p>See an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/ddsamp.htm"> 
actual data dictionary</a> for more examples and specifics. Note that the linked 
examples don't need to contain programming code and function calls to be 
effective. Putting programming code in tables is simply one TOP technique among 
many, but not a prerequisite.</p>

<h3>The End of Linear Paradigms</h3>

Data dictionaries greatly reduce the need for bulky field
specifications often used in OOP:

<pre><code>field1.property1 = x
field1.property2 = x
field1.property3 = x
...etc...
field1.property29 = x
field1.property30 = x
field2.property1 = x
field2.property2 = x
...etc...
field49.property1 = x
field49.property2 = x
field49.property3 = x
...etc...
field50.property30 = x
</code></pre>

<p>I see these constructs all over VB and Java code. A construct like this is 
crying out for a tabled alternative when you have several dozen fields and 
several properties/functions. </p>
<p>If you have 4 tables with 20 fields each, and each 
field averages 15 used properties, then you would have to write about 1,200 
lines of code. (4 x 20 x 15) However, this could be converted into a table that 
is about 80 by 20 in cell dimensions (we are assuming that there are a total of 
20 properties and/or functions). </p>
<p>The 2D nature of tables makes them much more 
compact and logical for representing similar information. This applies to <a 
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/cntrl1.htm">control 
tables</a> as well as DD's.  Code that repeats 
similar, but slightly different constructs or assignments over and over again is 
sometimes called "comb" code, or "E" code because of it's repetitous appearance. 
(Stacked E's resemble a <a 
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/buzzword.htm#comb">comb</a>).

<h3> Optional Data Dictionary </h3>

<p>Although data dictionaries are very powerful, they should be optional. This 
is 
because DD's are a bit formal and take some effort to build, just like any good 
organizational paradigm. You should be able to generate a quick data table in a 
program without having to fill out a DD. Not all tables and lists require high 
levels of formality, especially if there are only a few fields. TOP does not 
focus on just large or just small tables. Tables may be quick, ad-hoc array-like 
structures, billion-record IRS transactions, or something in-between. DD's 
should not be shoved down one's throat. </p>

<div class="reference">
	<i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/top.htm">Table-Oriented Programming</a></i>, Tablizer/TOPMind, 1998-2002
</div>
</div>

<p>This is an area where Raku's 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradual_typing">Gradual Typing</a> system 
is very much aligned with the goal here.  </p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h3> Detached Data Dictionary </h3>

<p>In addition to being optional, DD's should not be built into the table file 
itself. This is where Microsoft Access goes wrong. DD's cannot be shared as 
easily if there must be a one-to-one relationship with each table. (One-to-one 
DD's can still be built if desired). For example, sometimes the same or similar 
structures and operations are used with many different tables.</p>

<p>Allowing all such tables to share one or few DD's makes maintanence much 
easier. Plus, tables from different systems can be accessed without having to 
convert to or from its native DD's. </p>

<p>A TOP application should make it easy to physically
separate the program code, data dictionary, and actual
tables if so desired. An option to jam them altogether
like MS-Access prefers should also be given.</p>

<p>In the DD example, the Table-Name column allows asterisks to indicate that 
the Field-Name will be used to find the appropriate entry. For example, several 
tables may have a CustName field in them. Rather then creating an entry for each 
table, an asterisk is put in the TableSpec column to serve as a wild-card.</p>

<h3> Extendable Data Dictionary </h3>

<p>In addition to being optional, the DD should also be extendable if
needed by the application. TOP should only expect that a certain minimum
set of fields be included. The developer should be able to add 
fields to the data dictionary as needed. </p>

<p>For example, if a certain action happens when a field is double-clicked,
the data dictionary should be able to have a new column to enter the
snippet or function call for each field upon double-clicking. This
example assumes that double-clicking is not already part of the minimum
standards.</p>

<h3>Pre and Post Validation Functions</h3>

<p>The pre- and post-validation functions are a very powerful part of TOP. They 
allow consistent processing of fields regardless of where they are entered or 
displayed. For example, the pre-validation function executes regardless of 
whether the data was entered in a form, a grid, or any other input approach 
(assuming a short-cut outside of TOP is not used).</p>

<p>The pre-validation function serves two purposes. First, it checks the data to 
see that it is correct, and second, formats the field data for storage. For 
instance, a date may be input as "12/31/1998". The pre-validation function may 
change it to "19981231" before storing it in the actual table. If the user 
entered "12/32/1998", then the function would return a value of 'false' indicating an error. The function may resemble this psuedo code:</p>

<pre><code>  Boolean Function Vdate1()  
    boolean status = true     // initialize
    yearpart = substr(curfld,7,4)
    monthpart = substr(curfld,1,2)
    daypart = substr(curlfd,4,2)
    if not between(monthpart,"01","12") _
       or not between(daypart,"01","31") then
      status = false
      curmsg = "Bad month or day number"
    else
      curout = convert2yyyymmdd(curfld)
    endif
    return(status)   // true if passed
  End Function
</code></pre>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Curfld, Curmsg, and Curout are pre-assigned variables.  The TOP system 
		automatically prepares and uses these variables before and after the 
		function is triggered by user or batch actions. </li> 
	<li>Curfld is the current field as entered by the user</li>
	<li>Curmsg is the error message given to the user if the validation fails (a 
		default is assigned if not programmed)</li>
	<li>Curout is the field re-formatted for storage</li>
	<li>Another such reserved variable may be the length of the native 
		string</li>
</ul>

<p>This variable assignment method is only one possible approach to 
pre-validation routines; depending on the programming language, it may be better 
to pass these as function parameters instead.</p>

<div class="reference">
	<i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/top.htm">Table-Oriented Programming</a></i>, Tablizer/TOPMind, 1998-2002
</div>
</div>

<p>In Raku, these would definitely be done with function parameters, and 
either multiple return values, or a return associative array.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Post-validation routines re-format the input for display. There is no 
true/false return value since it was already checked during input. Therefore, 
the return value will be the reformatted field. For example, if the stored value 
is "19981231", then the post-validation function can turn it into "12/31/1998". 
In short, the post-validation function makes the output prettier or easier to 
read. The example above uses Datefmt1(2). This sample function returns the date 
with years shown as 2-digits. (The function may get the original value from a 
Curfld-like variable as shown in the pre-validation example).</p>

<div class="reference">
	<i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/top.htm">Table-Oriented Programming</a></i>, Tablizer/TOPMind, 1998-2002
</div>
</div>

<p>I've noticed a weakness -- the post-validation might happen too early, and 
then we're left with the formatted version, instead of the version we wanted to 
work with.  Probably the most useful option in a Raku context would be if this 
were done with stringification.  </p>

<p>Note also that for common types (eg. dates), we should have objects that do 
this, and these post-validation functions shouldn't need to be used nearly as 
often</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It may seem like a pain to write pre- and post-validation functions, but 
remember that the same functions can be used over and over again.  The inputs 
and outputs to these functions are generic enough that generic functions can be 
written for common formats like dates, phone numbers, etc. Thus, you do not have 
to re-invent the wheel for similar field types. Although the programmer is 
expected to build all the validation functions, a pre-built set could be 
included in the DD kit to save steps or serve as examples.</p>

<div class="reference">
	<i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/top.htm">Table-Oriented Programming</a></i>, Tablizer/TOPMind, 1998-2002
</div>
</div>

<p>...and this is where Raku shines -- the stringification and formatting 
functions are all built into the objects, though you can override them if 
useful.</p>

<p>In short, while I agree with the idea of having data dictionaries, Raku's 
existing features may make some of the fields in this example data dictionary 
less useful.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h3>Sort Orders</h3>

<p>Data Dictionary Sort orders specify the order that fields appear on reports 
and screens. In our example the fields are given an order in the Sort-1 column.
The DD could also have a Sort-2 column, Sort-3 column, etc.</p>

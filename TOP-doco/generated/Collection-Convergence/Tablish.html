<h1>The Tableish</h1>

<p>The Tableish is a role that represents all features common to Tables and 
Views.  Features include:</p>

<h3>Column Access</h3>

<p>In a Raku TOP Tableish, columns are accessed using the Associative role.  This 
means that we can use <code>$table&lt;column&gt;</code> or 
<code>$table{$column-name}</code> access methods (the second used when the 
name of the column is in a variable).  </p>

<h3>Row Access</h3>

<p>In a Raku TOP Tableish, rows are accessed using the Positional role.  This 
means that we can use <code>$table[$rownum]</code> to pick out a particular row.  
</p>

<h3>Row Iteration</h3>

<p>When we choose to iterate over a table, it will by default iterate over the 
rows of the table (rather than, say, the columns).  </p>


<h3>Transferring</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

This is the easy ability to transfer or copy information from one collection to
another.

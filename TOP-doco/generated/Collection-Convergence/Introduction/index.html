<div class="title">Type Convergence</div>

<p>The short version of this page is "Raku already does these things".</p>

<h1>Scalar Type Convergence</h1>

<div class="blockquote">
The proliferation of field types has made data more
difficult to transfer or share data between different
applications and generates confusion. TOP has only
two fundamental data types: numeric and character, and
perhaps a byte type for conversion purposes.
(I have been kicking around 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/L.htm">
ideas</a> for having only one type).
The pre- and post-validators give any special
handling needed by the field. A format string
can be provided for various items like dates ("99/99/99"),
Social-Security-Numbers ("999-99-9999"), and so forth.
(Input formats are not shown in our sample DD).
<p>
Types like dates and SSN's can be internally represented (stored) just fine with characters or possibly integers. For example, December 31, 1998 could be represented as "19981231". This provides a natural sort order.
<p>
Booleans can be represented with "Y" and "N" (yes and no)
and blank for uninitialized. This has the advantage of
adding more codes in the future if 2 turn out not to be enough.
Further, I have witnessed RDBMS numeric ID numbers being changed into
strings and visa verse. Being type-agnostic reduces or
eliminates the code changes needed after external or data
source type changes. (Fortunately, ID numbers rarely are
compared with greater-than and/or less-than operators. There
are drawbacks to type-agnosticism, but overall I think
the benefits are greater).
<p>
Enforcement of format can be done via validation specifiers
(both built-in and custom).
Fewer language types increases the share-ability and portability of data.

<p>Raku has gone one better, with the following features:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Scalars:</b> This is the Perl feature that has made its way into many 
		scripting languages including Raku (and was probably not original to 
		Perl).  This is a single type that represents numbers, strings, or 
		whatever</li> 
	<li><b>Gradual typing:</b> A type system where some variables and 
		expressions may be given types, and others not.  See Wikipedia's 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradual_typing">Gradual 
		Typing</a> article.</li> 
</ul>

<h1>Collection Type Convergence</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There is a pattern to many of the recommendations (ie. <a 
href="Concepts/Database-Engine-Neutrality.html">Database Engine Neutrality</a> 
and <a href="Concepts/Data-Dictionaries.html">Data Dictionaries</a>): 
Collection Convergence.</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="https://wayland.github.io/table-oriented-programming/TOP-doco/generated/Concepts/Collection-Convergence/converge.gif" border="0" alt="convergence diagram">
</div>

<p>Right now many systems have roughly four different collections protocols or 
protocol types. 
Is there a reason for this? One may argue that different collections have different 
needs, and thus specialization is required. Although this is certainly true for the 
<b>implementation</b> much of the time, I find this generally not to be the case with the 
collection <b>protocols</b> themselves. The primary reason is that requirements change too often. 
A collection may start out as a tree or a stack, but <b>morphs</b> 
into a more general-looking collection as more requirements are needed. 
I have experienced this process on several occasions.
(See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/collrght.htm#taxonomy">
The Collection Taxonomy Trap</a>  for more about this, and
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/prpats.htm#dispatch">
The Multi-Dispatch Pattern</a> for some source code management ideas).</p>

<div class="sidebar">
 You may notice that my rejection of strong protocol taxonomies 
parallels my distaste for heavy use of sub-classing, also known as 
sub-typing and IS-A thinking. Software engineering has over-emphasized 
IS-A thinking. Perhaps in some niches it has an important place, but not 
for custom business applications.
</div>

<p>Besides morphability and scalability (described in previous
section), another benefit is <b>easier training</b>. 
Instead of learning four or more <b>different</b> collection 
management systems, one should only have to learn a single protocol. 
Fine adjustments and specialized extensions can then be added 
on as needed (such as a Pop(x) "wrapper" function for stack-like activity).</p>

<p>A third advantage is that the same collection system can be
used for all the different collection types and variations.
Rather than build a class/code
browser, an RDBMS browser, an array browser, etc.; vendors
can <b>focus</b> on building one grand collection system
and browser that does it all. It could even be modular such
that you can attach different text browsing engines that
highlight code keywords, etc. </p>

<p>Even if you disagree with my specific protocol and/or syntax proposals, 
the idea of a consistent collection protocol should ring through 
as a very logical idea.

<div class="reference">
        <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/top.htm">Table-Oriented Programming</a></i>, Findy Services and B. Jacobs, 1998-2002
</div>
</div>

<p>Raku has gone with the "everything-is-an-object" model prevalent in modern 
programming languages (this is the heavy use of sub-classing that they are 
complaining about).  From a usability point of view, this model is a good thing, 
as long as it is also acknowledged "most things are not <i>just</i> an object" 
(and here I may be disagreeing with Findy Services and B. Jacobs).  Raku has 
been fairly good about this in most areas, though there are some areas where 
objects could be supplemented with alternate syntaxes (concurrency springs to 
mind).</p>

<p>What this means for TOP in Raku is that all collections are objects, and have
fairly
consistent interfaces (roles), including:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Associative Arrays:</b> objects where items can be gotten with string 
		keys</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Documented at <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/hashmap">Hashes and maps</a></li>
		<li>Examples at <a href="https://uzluisf.gitlab.io/raku-by-example/hashes/">
			Raku by Example: Hashes</a></li>
        <li>In-depth at role <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Associative">Associative</a></li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Positional arrays:</b> objects where items can be gotten using a 
		numeric positional key</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Documented at <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/list">Lists, sequences, and arrays</a></li>
		<li>Examples at <a href="https://uzluisf.gitlab.io/raku-by-example/lists-and-arrays/">
			Raku by Example: Lists and Arrays</li>
        <li>In-depth at role <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Positional">Positional</a></li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Iterators:</b> objects that will loop over items and return values 
		one after another</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Documented at <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/iterating">
			Iterating</a></li>
		<li>Examples at <a href="https://uzluisf.gitlab.io/raku-by-example/loops/">
			Raku by Example: Loops</a>; these examples use iterators, but 
			don't really explain them (which can be a good thing)</li>
        <li>In-depth at role <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Iterator">Iterator</a></li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<p>Note that, while these appear from the linked documentation to be quite 
complex, if you look at the examples, you'll see that using them is quite 
simple.</p>

<p>None of the above are tables, but can be used as building blocks to construct 
objects that will represent tables</p>

<h1>Collection Bill of Rights</h1>

<p>This is a list of things that Findy Services and B. Jacobs believe should be 
possible on any collection; cf. the 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121111043922/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/collrght.htm">
Collection Bill of Rights</a>.</p>

<h3>Implementation Features</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Virtual Size Caching: </b> Should be taken care of in the 
		backend</li>
	<li><b>Easy Persistence:</b> Should be taken care of in the backend</li>
	<li><b>Exporting/Importing:</b> Can be taken care of with different backends 
		+ the Transferring language feature</li>
	<li><b>Multi-sized Table Access:</b> Can be taken care of with different 
		backends</li>
	<li><b>Active Portion Sharing: </b> Unsure whether this is a Language or 
		Implementation feature</li>
	<li><b>Indices:</b> Unsure whether this is a language or implementation 
		feature.  Note that this item can only be seen by examining the 
		source code of the Collection Bill of Rights page.  </li>

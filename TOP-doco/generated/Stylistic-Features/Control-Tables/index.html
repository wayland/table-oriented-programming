<div class="title">Control Tables</div>

<div class="tagline">Tim Nelson, 2024</div>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<div class="blockquote">

<p> Control Tables are tables that control the program flow or play a major part 
in program control. Control Tables often have expressions or function references 
stored in them. Control Tables reduce the need for programming similar 
structures over and over again. The two-dimensional nature of tables makes them 
easier to view and update than the one-dimensional nature of program code. In 
some cases, non-programmers can be assigned to maintain the control tables. <p>

<p>All <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/cntrl1.htm">
control tables</a>, such as the DD's, should be regular tables that can be 
processed just like any data table. Encryption or some other technology can be 
used to protect such tables from direct access by users if needed.</p>

</div>
</div>

<h1>Benefits</h1>

<p>The following are some of the benefits of Control Tables.</p>

<h3>Easy to Change</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Easier to make software changes because only control tables (such as DD's) 
need be changed in many instances. It is easier to go to a table for changes 
than hunt around 20,000 lines program of code. <u>A table (grid) is a much 
easier structure to use for viewing, comparing, and changing properties of 
similar "objects" than program code.</u> This is because grids are 
two-dimensional structures, while program code is basically a one-dimensional 
structure.</p>

<div class="reference">
	<i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/top.htm">Table-Oriented Programming</a></i>, Tablizer/TOPMind, 1998-2002
</div>
</div>

<p>See <a href="RAD/Code-Editors.html#Tablish">Tablish Code Editor</a> for more 
information on editing grids</p>

<h3>Anonymous Function Calls</h3>

<p>Anonymous functions can be stored in control tables, and called when 
relevant, unlike SQL, which doesn't allow you to store code in tables</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<ul>
	<li>Allows tables to hold internal function calls and expressions, not just 
		values or SQL expressions. This helps build powerful control tables, 
		including the DD. ...
	<a name="sql_eval"></a>
	<li>Ability to evaluate table processing calls with internal expressions and 
		functions, not just SQL. For example, in XBase a statement like 
		<code>replace all pay with CalcRate() * hours</code> calculates all 
		employee paychecks in a table. In SQL this could resemble:
		<code>"Update emp set pay = CalcRate() * hours"</code>.  However, in 
		standard SQL you cannot "pass" the CalcRate function to the SQL 
		processor; you are stuck with SQL's built-in functions or proprietary 
		"stored" procedure calls that are separate from your code. (Note that 
		CalcRate may use many fields in a record.  Thus, it cannot be "blind" to 
		the "current" record).  Working with SQL is like having a wall that 
		separates your code from SQL's table processing.  TOP breaks down this 
		wall.</li>
</ul>

</div>
</div>

<h1>Control Panels</h1>

<div class="blockquote">

<h2> Tables as Concise Control Panels </h2>

<div class="sidebar">
Note that situations where putting code in
tables is either somewhat limited or best
kept separate from the control (feature
selection) information. This may depend on,
for example, if there is a common one-to-one
relationship between instances and
implementation. If implementations tend to
come from picking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/prpats.htm#strategy">strategies</a>
potentially shared by multiple instances, then putting
code in tables may not make much sense (at least
not in the same table). This is roughly equivalent to
factoring out common code into a shared subroutine
rather than repeating it for each instance. Putting
code in tables is more useful for competing with
artificial OOP examples which try to justify merging
data with behavior at almost any cost, than it is for real world use.
An application can roughly be
split into data, control information, and implementation.
I am planning on writing
more about this issue in the future. Even when I do
put code in tables, it is usually very small snippets
that call other functions/services. Thus, they are actually
a hybrid of code and strategy specifiers.
</div>

Even if you don't put code directly in tables, tables
make a very nice "control panel" to manage "high-level"
information. Unlike OOP classes, tables usually
don't mix implementation information with the
"settings" of the switches and knobs. Tables usually
tell <b>what</b> to do, not how to do it.
You don't have the equivalent of OOP
method code <b>mixed in</b> with
simple attribute assignments.
This is what allows tables to be
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/oopbad.htm#melding">shared</a> with
many different languages and paradigms.
OO fans proudly call the mixing "encapsulation."
However, I call it mucking up potentially
simple, concise information by mixing it
with nitty-gritty implementation details. OO
misses a grand opportunity for separation of
concerns. The information content of table-based
control information is roughly 5 to 20 times
more dense than algorithm code per character
I would estimate. It tells more in less space.
<p>
A flag or code in a table may say, "I do
feature X", but one does not have to bathe
in the details about how feature X is
actually implemented right then and there.
The simple "what" is not mixed up with the
complex "how". Mixing them <b>drags them
both down</b>. A tabular bus schedule tells when and
where the busses will be, but does not
bring up <b>how</b> the busses will get
there. If we mixed such information together,
few would bother to ride the bus. You would
have to slog through information or structures about diesel
combustion in order to find the arrival times.

<div align="center">
<img src="Stylistic-Features/Control-Tables/knobs.gif" alt="Control Panel" border="0">

<small>
  <font face="arial">
    The table user <b>only sees the settings</b>;
    <br>the implementation is hidden behind the
    panel.
    <br> (May your tables be simpler than this box).
  </font>
</small>
</div>
<p>

Tables are also more compact than OOP classes
for viewing high-level control information because
tables lay out information using 2 dimensions
instead of the single (linear) dimension of
OOP classes.
<p>
UNIX-based architectures stumbled upon a simple yet powerful
conceptual framework: the use of files and text streams as
an inter-process communication medium. This paradigm (or
sub-paradigm) makes it easy to mix different languages
and makes a clear and inspect-able "communications gathering
point", the file/stream, regardless of how
complicated or messy the algorithms and code is.
One could always look at the file or stream to
get a "neutral point of reference".
("The Unix Philosophy", ISBN: 1555581234. Note that
I am not promoting UNIX itself. OS's are one of the
few things I don't have strong opinions about, other than
perhaps case-sensitivity and file systems).
<p>
Tables provide the <b>next generation</b> of this
concept. They provide a concise communications gathering point
and can be shared by many different languages and
paradigms. Making convoluted code is unfortunately
much easier than making a convoluted table.  Further,
there is more incentive to keep them clean because
non-programmers can also read tables for the most
part, including your boss. And, unlike files and
streams, you don't have to keep copying the same
data over and over for each step; and you get concurrency.
<p>
It is like everybody going to Ebay to bargain instead
of having different little bargaining rules for each store.
(I hope you are getting the notion by now because I am
running out of analogies).

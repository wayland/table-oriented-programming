<div class="blockquote">

<h2> Tables as Concise Control Panels </h2>

<div class="sidebar">
Note that situations where putting code in
tables is either somewhat limited or best
kept separate from the control (feature
selection) information. This may depend on,
for example, if there is a common one-to-one
relationship between instances and
implementation. If implementations tend to
come from picking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/prpats.htm#strategy">strategies</a>
potentially shared by multiple instances, then putting
code in tables may not make much sense (at least
not in the same table). This is roughly equivalent to
factoring out common code into a shared subroutine
rather than repeating it for each instance. Putting
code in tables is more useful for competing with
artificial OOP examples which try to justify merging
data with behavior at almost any cost, than it is for real world use.
An application can roughly be
split into data, control information, and implementation.
I am planning on writing
more about this issue in the future. Even when I do
put code in tables, it is usually very small snippets
that call other functions/services. Thus, they are actually
a hybrid of code and strategy specifiers.
</div>

Even if you don't put code directly in tables, tables
make a very nice "control panel" to manage "high-level"
information. Unlike OOP classes, tables usually
don't mix implementation information with the
"settings" of the switches and knobs. Tables usually
tell <b>what</b> to do, not how to do it.
You don't have the equivalent of OOP
method code <b>mixed in</b> with
simple attribute assignments.
This is what allows tables to be
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/oopbad.htm#melding">shared</a> with
many different languages and paradigms.
OO fans proudly call the mixing "encapsulation."
However, I call it mucking up potentially
simple, concise information by mixing it
with nitty-gritty implementation details. OO
misses a grand opportunity for separation of
concerns. The information content of table-based
control information is roughly 5 to 20 times
more dense than algorithm code per character
I would estimate. It tells more in less space.
<p>
A flag or code in a table may say, "I do
feature X", but one does not have to bathe
in the details about how feature X is
actually implemented right then and there.
The simple "what" is not mixed up with the
complex "how". Mixing them <b>drags them
both down</b>. A tabular bus schedule tells when and
where the busses will be, but does not
bring up <b>how</b> the busses will get
there. If we mixed such information together,
few would bother to ride the bus. You would
have to slog through information or structures about diesel
combustion in order to find the arrival times.

  <font face="arial">
    The table user <b>only sees the settings</b>;
    <br>the implementation is hidden behind the
    panel.
    <br> (May your tables be simpler than this box).
  </font>
</small>
</div>
<p>

Tables are also more compact than OOP classes
for viewing high-level control information because
tables lay out information using 2 dimensions
instead of the single (linear) dimension of
OOP classes.
<p>
UNIX-based architectures stumbled upon a simple yet powerful
conceptual framework: the use of files and text streams as
an inter-process communication medium. This paradigm (or
sub-paradigm) makes it easy to mix different languages
and makes a clear and inspect-able "communications gathering
point", the file/stream, regardless of how
complicated or messy the algorithms and code is.
One could always look at the file or stream to
get a "neutral point of reference".
("The Unix Philosophy", ISBN: 1555581234. Note that
I am not promoting UNIX itself. OS's are one of the
few things I don't have strong opinions about, other than
perhaps case-sensitivity and file systems).
<p>
Tables provide the <b>next generation</b> of this
concept. They provide a concise communications gathering point
and can be shared by many different languages and
paradigms. Making convoluted code is unfortunately
much easier than making a convoluted table.  Further,
there is more incentive to keep them clean because
non-programmers can also read tables for the most
part, including your boss. And, unlike files and
streams, you don't have to keep copying the same
data over and over for each step; and you get concurrency.
<p>
It is like everybody going to Ebay to bargain instead
of having different little bargaining rules for each store.
(I hope you are getting the notion by now because I am
running out of analogies).

<h2>Future of TOP</h2>

This set of documents is not meant to be the final
word on TOP. There are many aspects to be explored
and evaluated by different  personalities
with different perspectives. Concepts such as
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/cntrl1.htm">Control Tables</a> and
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/collrght.htm">Standard Collection Operations</a> (SCO)
could possibly be carried to deeper levels
than given here in order to see what new ideas and issues
arise.
<p>
What if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024051826/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/allway.htm">all subclass code</a>
was in
Control Tables instead of just stubs and
expressions? What if all collections
were represented and linked within SCO?
What if the concepts of
Control Tables and SCO were tightly
combined? How does the world look if
you start to view or model it as collections
based on SCO. Questions like these have
not be explored very well yet.

<p>
Taking concepts to the extreme many not
by itself produce practical results, but can
often trigger new ways of thinking.
I believe there is plenty of room for
brainstorming. It is hard to believe
that OOP (by itself) is the pinnacle
of paradigms.

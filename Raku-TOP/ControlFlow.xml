<p>This will provide an introduction to a few Raku TOP features that add new 
Control Flow mechanisms.  These will likely be the last features implemented,
so it may be more useful at this point to skip forward to Relation.  </p>

<h1>Transactions</h1>

<div class="not-implemented">
<code>atom $database [, $database2] {
  &lt;database actions&gt;
  throw Exception.new;
}</code></div>

<p>The <code>atom</code> structure holds a transaction on a database.  It's basically a normal block, but the
the KEEP and UNDO phasers are automatically tied to the commit/rollback functions on the databases provided.</p>

<p>If database actions are performed outside an atom block, then they're
done in direct mode, rather than transactional mode.  </p>

<p>As per <a href="/#UI-churn">Introduction to 
Programming Productivity</a>, the database experts should be in control of the 
architecture.  </p>

<p>Where possible, this should automatically flow through to the frontend.  When 
someone adds a database field to a form, there should be the possibility that 
the correct editing control will be recommended by the form editor, which means 
that that information should be stored in the database.  Not a control to 
<i>always</i> use, but a recommendation to the frontend developer.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Use of checkboxes, icons, etc. as representations of fields should be 
definable in the DD. Perhaps this can be done by having the post-validation 
function return a string with a special code for GUI components. For example, a 
checkbox might be specified with "@gui:checkbox value=on". An icon could be 
represented as such: "@gui:icon file='folder.gif'".</p>

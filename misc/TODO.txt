Content
-------

-	Document Raku classes
	-	Change the left bar so that we have table of contents for the site there (like Confluence)
	-	Start work
		-	For each class, write a guide for people doing backend classes, telling them not to read the whole thing 
			into memory, because we want to be able to work with really large data

	-	Data Dictionary
		-	Work through http://www.martymodell.com/pgsa2/pgsa08.html and make mine resemble it more
			where useful; also note this link in the doco.  Might even be worth buying the book
			Specifically, look at the diagram part way down, and work with that model
		-	The 7 purposes at https://atlan.com/purpose-of-a-data-dictionary/ should probably be Lots
			-	Turns out that, apart from Governance, they're all just different kinds of doco
		-	Draw fields from:
			https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/irpe/about/data_governance/_files/DataDictionaryStandards.pdf
			Typical Attributes section of: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dictionary

Currently expecting we'll effectively end up with the following semi-separate sites (maybe sharing the first menu)
-	Programming Productivity, which introduces TOP and RAD
-	TOP
-	Raku TOP
-	RAD


-	Make the Language Analogy a separate page; pull in the noun-verb priority stuff
-	Pull in material from https://web.archive.org/web/20121102222751/http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/oopbad.htm#isa

#TODO Maybe write an article about why Raku is the perfect programming language for research, because:
#-       Flexible grammar, slangs
#-       Already has many paradigms -- no need to reinvent the wheel



Interface
---------

-	Then try to make the menus work on mobile -- there might be some ideas at https://freefrontend.com/css-mobile-menus/
	-	Maybe put the previous/next navigation at the top, and the menu icon in the centre


Questions for the Raku people
-----------------------------


Question 1
----------
I'm trying to create a Table class which can be passed a record with values of particular types.  

Is it possible to:
-	Pass a signature to an object on creation
-	Later use that signature to constrain a set of values passed in

Question 2
----------
How do Sets know whether items are the same or not?  Partial Answer: ACCEPTS does the comparison between sets; not sure about 
comparison between items


Two-dimensional Programming
---------------------------
-	Table-Oriented Programming
-	Dataflow Programming
-	?UI drawing
-	Office Programming
	-	Spreadsheet = TOP
	-	Writer = Reports, but also coding; we can have styles with meaning
